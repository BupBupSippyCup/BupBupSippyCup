Well met! I am BupBupSippyCup, and I would love to get my hands dirty (with software, that is! So... not dirty). I have some painfully basic knowledge of Python, CSS, Javascript and HTML, so I definitely need to brush up on it as soon as I start writing code. first desire is to create a comic dubbed style Choose Your Own Adventure application, therefore any feedback on the idea as a whole, or specifics on how to approach this would be greatly appreciated! I bid all a good day, regardless!
